This is the official GitHub repository for the latest builds of _Reignite_, a rhythm game featuring the violin as its primary instrument created by a small team of developers. 

_Reignite_ is based around the high school orchestra, featuring concertos, duets, and symphonies by classical composers. In this build, by navigating to Practice mode, you can play four songs on the Beginner difficulty. Additionally, the tutorial song can be played on both Intermediate and Advanced difficulties. We are planning for _Reignite_ to have between 15 and 25 playable songs spanning a story told through a one-panel comic style in four acts.

You can learn more about _Reignite_ through our development blog, found here: http://reignite-blog.tumblr.com.

Known issues:

1. Attempting to play any song on Intermediate or Advanced difficulty other than the Warm Up will not load a note chart properly.
    
2. Changing the control scheme in the Options window does not load the proper set of keys in the UI for the rhythm game. The left-hand keyboard keys are set, however, and are UIOP/7890.
    
3. The "New Game" and "Load Game" buttons do not function. This is due to the main game mode not being implemented yet.
